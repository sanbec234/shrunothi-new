Connection Between Personal Values and Organizational Roles
business
As coaches, Anu and I have been exploring the powerful relationship between a person’s core values and the role they play within an organization.
We've observed how a mismatch between personal values and professional responsibilities can lead to demotivation, disengagement, and even a sense of alienation from the organization.
On the other hand, when values and roles align, individuals often feel more inspired, self-driven, and committed—leading to meaningful contributions to their teams and the organization’s overall growth.

Let us share a real-life example that illustrates this connection.

### A Case Study: When Roles Clash with Values

We once worked with an employee who, when asked to reflect on the three most important things in his life, identified:

1. Family
2. Financial stability
3. Personal time—including time for self-care, relationships, and family.

These were his non-negotiables—values he deeply cared about and wanted to preserve at any cost.

Initially, in his role as a field executive, his lifestyle aligned well with these priorities. He earned a decent income, had predictable working hours (9 AM to 5 PM), and could spend ample time with his family. His performance was strong, and he felt a sense of belonging in the organization.

However, after a promotion, he was transferred to another state. While his skills, competence, and ability to build rapport remained high, he began to feel emotionally disconnected from the role.
The reason? His new responsibilities demanded longer hours and physical distance from his family. Though he was earning more, he found himself unable to prioritize time for family and personal well-being.
This inner conflict began to drain his motivation and affect his performance—to the point where he started considering leaving the organization.

### The Coaching Intervention

During our coaching session, we didn’t start by talking about organizational goals or performance metrics. Instead, we revisited what truly mattered to him: his family’s well-being.

Through conversation, he realized that while he was physically away from his family, the increased income from the promotion could provide them with much-needed financial security.
This helped him reframe the situation—not as a compromise of values, but as a temporary adjustment in service of a deeper value: supporting and securing his family's future.

This shift in perception helped him reconnect with his role, accept the short-term trade-offs, and begin to see purpose and meaning in his new responsibilities.
As a result, he regained motivation and took ownership of his role with renewed energy and commitment.

### A Simple Coaching Tool

This experience highlights a simple yet profound coaching approach:

1. Ask people to identify the three most important things in their life.
2. Invite them to describe their current role—how their day, week, and month are structured.
3. Facilitate a reflection on where their role complements their values, and where it might be in conflict.

This reflection fosters awareness. And when individuals begin to see a connection—even a small one—between their values and their role, motivation becomes an internal force rather than something imposed externally.

### Navigating Value-Role Conflicts

Sometimes, this awareness can lead to the realization that the current role cannot support what matters most to them.
In such cases, the individual may choose to:

* Reframe the role by identifying overlooked alignments.
* Negotiate adjustments that better support their values.
* Explore alternate roles within the organization that offer a better fit.

It’s important to note: while values are often deeply felt and clearly understood, individuals may not always articulate how their current role impacts those values.
That's where coaching can help bridge the gap between inner clarity and external alignment.

### Conclusion

True motivation doesn’t come from pep talks or performance bonuses—it comes from within.
When people feel that their role is an expression of what matters most to them, they naturally take ownership, find purpose, and contribute with heart.

As coaches, our role is to hold space for that inner exploration, helping individuals discover the deep connection between who they are, what they value, and what they do.
