Dialog is a form of communication between two or more people to reorganize evolving individual thought processes to a collective thought process. A collective thought process is mandatory in an organizational context because no one individual can build an organization on his/her own. The dialog process gathers the collective energy and strength of all stakeholders including employees and is channelised towards growth of the organisation.

How is the process of dialog different from normal communication or conversations that are part of a day to day process at work?  
When a team is working together it is necessary to converse with each other for regular execution and completion of tasks — for example getting reports on time, fixing and achieving quarterly targets, finalising strategies etc. Every individual involved in the process is aware of his/her responsibility and the need to be civil and polite in their dealings with others. Everyone in the team knows that they need to be courteous with fellow team member to get a mutually supportive response. Such situations do not fall under the umbrella of dialog.

A structured and monitored dialog process is a form of communication that opens up the scope for converting prolonged problems, stuck situations, repeated and familiar frustrations in day to day work to instruments that can propel organisational growth. Prolonged unresolved problems, stuck situations, leashed potentials create frustrations in employees that drains their energy and rob them of inspirations and motivations that could contribute to growth of the organisation. In summary for the normal day today functioning a courteous conversation with the fellow team member is sufficient. A dialog on the other hand has the potential to open developmental possibilities by addressing unspoken frustrations among and between the employees.

A business coach trained in creating an environment for the dialoguing process can facilitate dialog in an organisation. Through the process of dialog, the business coach paves the way for nurturing a learning culture in the organisation. The trained coach will be competent in constructing and maintaining a neutral learning space that can facilitate dialog resulting in constructing a collective force propelled towards growth of the organisation. This neutral space ensures that there is an openness to learning, respect, empathy and an eye to eye level contact between participants of various designations.

What is the meaning of eye to eye level contact, empathy and learning culture in the process of facilitating a dialog in coaching?  
How and why build a learning culture? Bernd Schmid (Dr) defines culture ‘as a network of habits’. This network of habits in an organisation is created by people who are part of a responsibility chain in an organisation. Over a period, the habits are adapted without question and can create blocks in the path to growth. It is necessary to periodically weed out habits that come in the way of growth. This is not easy. When people in the chain learn together about their habits and collectively create new habits then the culture of the organization can change where necessary for the benefit of the organisation.

How does eye to eye level relationship operate?  
People with different designations and responsibilities sit together as equal learning partners. The objective is to handle or talk about prolonged unresolved problems, stuck situations, new possibilities by opening up communication channels between various levels. It does not mean that designations do not play a role or is given a go by. For example in a meeting where a learning space is created, a VP operations has the opportunity of understanding the difficulties of the field operators without the need to be defensive about what he is hearing. Instead of defending his policies or decisions, the VP can look at the exchange with the operators as an opportunity for course corrections. He could use his position/designation for allotting larger resources or influence a change in the system. The junior levels can share their thoughts and innovative ideas without fear of being dismissed or reprised. The understanding that we get through the process of dialog, maintaining eye to eye level contact is that employees at different levels are all interested in the same outcome, irrespective of their designations. Eye to eye level means people may have different designations but partner equally in growing the organisation.

What is Empathy in the context of work?  
My definition of empathy is, “showing care for the fellow human being without minimizing their capacity to handle their situations”. An MD of an organization, where we initiated organisation development work told me, “through business coaching if you can make people talk about their difficulties in the review meetings it will be of great help”. I see this MD is empathetic. One need not be a counsellor or a psychotherapist to show empathy.

In a chain of responsibilities, infusing empathy through dialog benefits the whole chain. It helps an individual feel understood without his competency being minimised. When there is empathy people feel safe to open up and share their thoughts, ideas and have a chance to develop an emotional bonding. When the team is strengthened through emotions and is cohesive in function the results can be extraordinary. A factory, where we initiated business coaching and facilitated dialog among various levels of the production team, tripled its production without additional resources. Dialog led to a fully cohesive cross functional teamwork that were able to overcome challenges, plan optimum use of resources and continue to sustain their practices even after ten years today.

In essence, Dialog is like water — it is a soft force but strong enough to move hard mountains.

However, being present in a learning space along with their reportees is not an easy task for many owners, investors, CEOs, senior managers etc. Such organisations where the top leadership does not take part in active learning space along with their teams are tightly wound up through bureaucracy. This differentiation between positions makes the organization hierarchical and blocks the bottom up co-ordination. If bureaucracy is not dealt with it will anyway prevent the organisation and its people from realising their full potential and flourish in a dynamic market. Dialog is an antidote to bureaucracy.

So then what are the elements that make the process of dialog successful?

- **Intention:** As a business coach, I am aware that not all organizations have an openness to development of a collective strength or do away with bureaucracy. However, an intention by the leadership to nurture collective strength, to share power so that the team can double their energy is sufficient. The required attitude to develop the collective strength through dialog can be learnt as a part of business coaching.  
- **Inquiry:** To develop a culture of dialog within an organization the key competence required by a business coach is to format a right inquiry. An inquiry is a mature form of question without a need for a predefined outcome. Inquiry is like a bottle opener which is required to open conversation within and between teams. An example of inquiry to inspire the individuals and team could be:  
  - What motivates them at work?  
  - When does their motivation drop?  
  - Where does the team work more and get less result?  
  These questions do not have a predefined answer but open a search for an answer.  
- **Eliciting Patterns:** Once the inquiry is set, the team shares their thoughts and reflections. The team conversations are then organized to see if there are any commonality or patterns. Dialog can also focus on what people will do/act individually and collectively to use the frustrations and aspirations as fuel to propel the organization forward.  
- **Including the right people in dialog:** In an organizational context who all need to dialog is of primary importance than what all needs to be dialogued. Hence in order to infuse dialog as a part of organization culture we prepare a culture of learning with the design as depicted below.

To create a safe space and get a sample of business coaching we always start with the leader of the organization. In this way the leader models being a learning champion. As a next step one more key member in the organization joins and we gradually increase the learning network aligned to work network. Such step by step introduction to learning within the organization is required to build the attitude and competence to dialog.

In a business coaching context the dialogs become multilogues since many people and many divisions combine together in conversations. The process of dialog helps to negotiate three layers in developing a congruent action as a team.

Layer 1 starts with Engagement and execution — as a part of business coaching the team dialogs about how they are engaging and executing projects currently.  
Layer 2 is about Empathy — dialog on understanding the difficulties and differences, and getting self-regulated. Self-regulation in an organizational context would be for an individual to be able to manage the insecurities, notice and open unexpressed expectations. Such regulations increase an individual’s ability to perform in an optimal zone.  
Layer 3 paves the way for Emerging possibilities. When the current challenges surface and are empathized, the environment becomes a space for exploring new ways of execution which lifts the organization.

**Case example:**  
An organization had already identified growth projects which were run by teams. To monitor the progress of the projects, the organization had arrived at some key criteria and flagged the progress in colours to indicate the stage of progress. Green colour meant the team is doing well and the outcome is achieved. Orange colour, a moderate success and red meant very poor performance. The organization wanted to work on the projects which had been in red for a prolonged period and invited me as a business coach to understand why the project was way behind schedule.

I led the meeting along with the learning and development head. My inquiry started with “who all can make difference to the project”? The project team was a mix of cross functional teams. So we invited the VP operations and VP R&D who both had the power to influence change and move the project from red to green. I met the team members individually and as a group and prepared them for dialog. Post preparation we had a whole day coaching session planned for the entire team getting coached together. The inquiry we formulated was, “how can we individually and collectively impact the project to move it to green?”

Production team said, if the quality department is able to provide approval on time then I will ensure quick productivity. The quality department people said, if the operations team ensure quality in the assembly then we could give a quick approval. The maintenance team said if the operations gives a shut down as per the schedule… like this we got a huge list from the team.

The emerging theme was “if the other department made the initiative”. I brought this to their notice and the team felt embarrassed to see how they pushed responsibility. They were able to see how this attitude to push the responsibility was creating stress for everyone. The team came up with the plan to volunteer in support of each other rather than waiting for the other team to initiate. While they made an action plan there were issues that were taken up with the R&D head and head of operations, about the unrealistic time lines and measure of the progress of the project. The leadership assured the team that they will get the measuring criteria updated in the audit. In a consistent 3 months follow up the project came to green and sustained green.

In summary, dialog ensures the attitude of eye to eye level engagement, empathy, and a learning culture that allows a right inquiry. Thereafter, organizing the thoughts and reflections shared by people, eliciting patterns and acting on changing the patterns in a collective way ensures growth of an organisation. The key benefits that the organization gains while dialoguing are that the diagnosis, the culture to address the gaps and the implementing of solutions happen simultaneously lifting the organization to new heights.
